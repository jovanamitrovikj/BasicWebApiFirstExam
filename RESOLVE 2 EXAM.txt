The following code is trying to fetch all the .txt files from a given directory and add “ASPEKT” inside them.
There are some minor bugs in the code. Find them, explain the issue, and how to fix it.




1. 
Recursive Call Error:
The recursive call to GetTxtFiles within the foreach loop should pass subDirectory, not directoryPath.

foreach (string subDirectory in subDirectories)
{
GetTxtFiles(subDirectory, txtFiles); // Pass subDirectory instead of directoryPath
}


2. 
StreamWriter  is Not Disposed:
The StreamWriter is not being disposed of, which can lead to resource leaks. Use a using statement to ensure it's properly disposed of.

and in this context remove the StreamWriter writer = null;
replace with :

using (StreamWriter writer = File.AppendText(filepath))
{
writer.WriteLine(textToAppend);
} // The writer is automatically disposed of at the end of the using block



class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
string directoryPath = @"Directorypath"; // Correct path
List<string> txtFiles = new List<string>();
GetTxtFiles(directoryPath, txtFiles);

foreach (var file in txtFiles)
{
AppendTextToFile(file, "ASPEKT");
}
}

static void GetTxtFiles(string directoryPath, List<string> txtFiles)
{
string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(directoryPath, "*.txt");
txtFiles.AddRange(files);

string[] subDirectories = Directory.GetDirectories(directoryPath);
foreach (string subDirectory in subDirectories)
{
GetTxtFiles(subDirectory, txtFiles); // Recursive call with correct parameter
}
}

static void AppendTextToFile(string filepath, string textToAppend)
{
using (StreamWriter writer = File.AppendText(filepath))
{
writer.WriteLine(textToAppend);
}
}
}
